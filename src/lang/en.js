      con1: 'Visually inspecting bridges plays a crucial role in assessing their structural integrity, traffic safety, and long-term durability in order to find the ideal timing for rehabilitation steps or to take immediate actions (e.g. limiting heavy traffic or closing a bridge). The current inspection process can be made more efficient by making use of computer vision models in order to automate the damage recognition. Therefore, we developed "dacl10k", an exceptionally diverse multi-label semantic segmentation dataset comprising 9,920 images derived by real-world bridge inspections. dacl10k distinguishes 13 damage classes as well as 6 bridge components that play a key role in bridge inspections. Thereby, it enables the classification, measurement and localisation of its classes on a pixel level. The challenge is to develop a model that can detect and classify the 19 classes of the dacl10k dataset.',
